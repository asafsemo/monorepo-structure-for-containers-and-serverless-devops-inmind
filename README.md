# monorepo-structure-for-containers-and-serverless-devops-inmind

**1. Introduction (Clear and concise overview):**

Service-Oriented Architecture (SoA)
Decoupling
Dependency Injection (DI)
Inversion of Control (IoC)
Observability in mind from the first line of code - Logs, traces & metrics 
Dynamic loading logic class
Dynamic loading of HTTP controllers
API documentation as part of each service
Examples of ci/cd scripts (coming soon) 
Centralized environment vars in one file (Yes, ask your devops about it. They will love it)
Support to run the code as a container or serverless 
Ready for tests


* **Project title and tagline:** Briefly describe your project's purpose and key features.
* **What is it?** Explain the concept of a monorepo and its benefits for this project.
* **Who is it for?** Identify your target audience (developers, DevOps engineers).
* **Getting started:** Provide a high-level overview of setting up and using the project.

**2. Project Structure (Detailed and organized breakdown):**

* **Directory listing:** List all directories and their brief descriptions.
* **Root directory:** Explain the contents of the root directory, such as `README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, and other essential files.
* **Packages:**
    * Describe how packages are organized (e.g., by functionality, technology).
    * Mention any naming conventions used for packages.
    * Briefly explain the purpose of each package (one paragraph per package).

**3. Development and Deployment (Comprehensive instructions):**

* **Prerequisites:** List any system requirements or dependencies (OS, tools, frameworks).
* **Setup:** Provide detailed instructions on how to set up the development environment, including:
    * Installation instructions for necessary tools and dependencies.
    * Configuration steps required for specific packages.
    * Environment variables setup (if applicable).
* **Building and running:** Explain the commands or processes to build, run, and test the project, incorporating CI/CD considerations:
    * Commands for building and/or compiling each package (optional, if applicable).
    * Instructions on how to run and test individual packages or the entire monorepo.
    * Mention any relevant scripts or configuration files for building and running.
    * If applicable, describe your CI/CD setup and how to interact with it.
* **Troubleshooting (optional):** Address common issues and provide solutions or resources.

**4. Dependency Injection and Inversion of Control (In-depth explanation):**

* **Explain the concepts:** Clearly define dependency injection (DI) and inversion of control (IoC) with examples relevant to your project.
* **How they are implemented:** Discuss how DI and IoC principles are applied within your codebase, addressing:
    * DI framework choices (if any) or custom implementation details.
    * Code examples demonstrating usage.
    * Benefits of using these principles in the context of your project.

**5. Contributing Guidelines (Promote engagement and collaboration):**

* **Contribution process:** Outline the steps on how to contribute, including:
    * How to create a pull request.
    * Code style conventions and formatting guidelines.
    * Testing requirements.
    * Code review process.
* **Community:**
    * Provide links to any communication channels (e.g., discussion forum, issue tracker) where contributors can interact.
    * Offer guidance on how to get involved in the project development.

**6. License (Clearly stated):**

* Include the license under which your project is distributed, using a recognized open-source license like MIT, Apache 2.0, or Creative Commons.

**Additionally:**

* **Clarity and conciseness:** Aim for a clear, concise, and well-organized writing style.
* **Structure and headings:** Employ clear section headings and subheadings for easy navigation.
* **Formatting:** Use code blocks, lists, and other formatting elements where appropriate.
* **Examples:** Include code snippets or examples to illustrate key points.
* **Version control:** Indicate which version control system you're using (e.g., Git) and link to relevant resources for beginners.
* **Maintainability:** Regularly update and maintain your README file to reflect changes in the project.

By following these guidelines and incorporating feedback from potential users, you can create a comprehensive and informative README file that effectively serves developers and DevOps engineers using your open-source monorepo project.
