# monorepo-structure-for-containers-and-serverless-devops-inmind

Hello, 
My name is Asaf Semo and I have decided to share my monorepo folder structure with the open source community.

You can fork this repo and start working on your monorepo project.
You can find an example project in the "apps" folder

with this strcuture you can run your code in serverless or containers 

Todo:
1. write more about the project and the libraries I am using and why
2. write more about DI and IoC
3. add CD/CD scripts for .circleci and .github actions
4. add the ui structure to the project
5. run the ui in the local docker compose file
